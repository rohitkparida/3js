# External Car Models Setup

## How to Add External 3D Car Models

### 1. Download Free Car Models
Here are some good sources for free car models:

**GLTF/GLB Format (Recommended):**
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount&type=models&q=car)
- [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/models)
- [Three.js Examples](https://threejs.org/examples/)

**Popular Free Car Models:**
- Search for "low poly car" or "simple car" models
- Look for GLTF (.glb) or GLTF (.gltf) formats
- Avoid complex models for better performance

### 2. Add Models to Project
1. Create a `models/` folder in your project
2. Download car models and place them in `models/`
3. Update the URLs in `js/vehicle-loader.js`

### 3. Update Vehicle Loader
In `js/vehicle-loader.js`, replace the model URLs:

```javascript
const carModels = [
    'models/car1.glb',
    'models/car2.glb', 
    'models/car3.glb',
    'models/car4.glb'
];
```

### 4. Model Requirements
- **Format**: GLTF (.glb) or GLTF (.gltf)
- **Size**: Keep under 1MB for web performance
- **Polygons**: Low-poly models work best
- **Scale**: Models will be auto-scaled to fit

### 5. Fallback System
If models fail to load, the system automatically falls back to simple geometric shapes.

### 6. Testing
Refresh the page to see the new car models in action!

## Current Status
- ✅ Vehicle loader system implemented
- ✅ GLTFLoader added to HTML
- ✅ Async loading system ready
- ⏳ Ready for external model files
